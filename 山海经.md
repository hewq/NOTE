南方首列山系叫作䧿山山系。山山系的头一座山，也是最西边的一座山，是招摇山，它屹立在西海岸边，山上生长着许多桂树，又蕴藏着丰富的金属矿物和玉石。山中有一种草，形状像韭菜却开着青色的花朵，名称是祝余，人吃了它就不感到饥饿。山中又有一种树木，形状像构树，却呈现黑色的纹理，它的花开放后发出耀眼光芒，照耀四方，名称是迷，人佩带它在身上就不会迷失方向。

山中还有一种野兽，形状像猿猴但长着一双白色的耳朵，既能匍匐爬行，又能像人一样直立行走，名称是狌狌。狌狌就是今天的猩猩，性情颇像人，高约四五尺，口内有牙齿三十二颗，鼻梁塌陷。狌狌一般在山林中用树叶建造小屋，然后居住其中。如果在年幼时将其捕捉，则能够被驯化而和主人和谐相处。古代的人认为吃了它的肉可以使人走得飞快。远古时期，中国南方气候湿热，类似于今天东南亚的热带岛屿，到处是原始森林，当时也许就有猩猩栖息。现在印度尼西亚的原始雨林中还有红毛猩猩分布，招摇山的猩猩大概就是这个种类吧。

古人传说猩猩会说人话，百余头为一群，出没山谷之中，它们知道过去却不能预测未来，还特别贪心，十分好酒和摆弄草鞋。于是当时的土人便常在路上摆酒，旁边还放上几十双连在一起的草鞋，猩猩走过便知道放置这两样东西的土人和他们祖先的名字。开始它们喊着土人和他们祖先的名字，还一边大骂：“又来诱惑我，才不上你们的当呢！”然后就走开。但过了一会儿它们又返回，眼睛盯着酒和草鞋，又骂，然后又走开。如此来回几次，终因抵受不住酒和草鞋的诱惑，便相互嚷着要喝酒，还把草鞋套在脚上。结果喝得大醉，这时土人便出来捕捉它们，醉醺醺的脑袋和连着的草鞋让它们想跑都跑不动，便一起被土人捉住。它们知道人类摆酒的目的，却因为贪心，禁不住诱惑而成为人类的盘中餐。古人认为猩猩的嘴唇很好吃，猩唇是“山八珍”之一。而且古人还保留着一种原始观念，认为只要吃了某种强悍的动物的肉，便会将对方的力量和灵气吸收到自己身上来。不光猩猩唇味道甘美，吃了它的肉，便能吸收了猩猩“善走”的本领，从而健步如飞。估计中国古代的猩猩就是因此而灭绝的吧。

招摇山除了有猩猩，还孕育了丽麂水，这条河从山涧中发源后，向西奔腾流入大海。水中有许多叫作育沛的东西，人佩带它在身上就不会生蛊胀病。



The first mountain range in the south is called the Qishan Mountain Range. The first mountain in the mountain range, and also the westernmost mountain, is Zhaoyao Mountain, which stands on the west coast. There are many laurel trees growing on the mountain, and it is rich in metal minerals and jade. There is a kind of grass in the mountain, which looks like leeks but has green flowers. It is called Zhuyu. People who eat it will not feel hungry. There is also a tree in the mountain, which looks like a mulberry tree, but has black textures. When its flowers bloom, they emit dazzling light that shines in all directions. It is called Mi. People who wear it will not get lost.

There is also a wild beast in the mountains, which looks like an ape but has a pair of white ears. It can crawl on the ground and walk upright like a human. It is called the guinea pig. The guinea pig is today's orangutan. It has a temperament similar to that of a human. It is about four or five feet tall, has 32 teeth in its mouth, and has a sunken nose. The guinea pig usually builds a hut with leaves in the forest and lives in it. If it is captured when it is young, it can be tamed and live in harmony with its owner. Ancient people believed that eating its meat could make people walk very fast. In ancient times, the climate in southern China was humid and hot, similar to the tropical islands in Southeast Asia today, with virgin forests everywhere. Orangutans may have lived there at that time. Orangutans are still distributed in the virgin rainforests of Indonesia today. The orangutans in Zhaoyao Mountain are probably of this species.

Ancient people said that orangutans can speak human language, and there are more than 100 of them in a group, which roams in the valley. They know the past but cannot predict the future. They are also very greedy and like wine and playing with straw sandals. So the natives at that time often set up wine on the road, and put dozens of pairs of straw sandals connected together next to them. The orangutans knew the names of the natives and their ancestors who placed these two things. At first, they shouted the names of the natives and their ancestors, and cursed: "You are tempting me again, I will not fall for your tricks!" Then they walked away. But after a while, they returned, stared at the wine and straw sandals, cursed again, and then walked away again. This went back and forth several times, and finally they could not resist the temptation of wine and straw sandals, so they shouted to each other to drink and put straw sandals on their feet. As a result, they got drunk, and then the natives came out to catch them. Their drunken heads and connected straw sandals made them unable to run away, so they were caught by the natives together. They knew the purpose of humans setting up wine, but because of greed, they could not resist the temptation and became human food. The ancients believed that orangutan lips were delicious, and orangutan lips were one of the "eight mountain delicacies". The ancients also retained a primitive concept that as long as they ate the meat of a certain powerful animal, they would absorb the opponent's strength and spiritual energy into themselves. Not only does the orangutan lips taste sweet, but eating its meat can also absorb the orangutan's ability to "walk well", thus walking briskly. It is estimated that the orangutans in ancient China became extinct because of this.

In addition to orangutans, Zhaoyao Mountain also gave birth to the Liji River, which originates from the mountain stream and rushes westward into the sea. There are many things called Yupei in the water, and people who wear it will not get Gu swollen disease.





In the far reaches of the southern lands, the mighty Qishan Mountain Range stretches out, its peaks shrouded in mist and mystery. The first and westernmost of these peaks is Zhaoyao Mountain, a towering presence that watches over the vast, wild coastline. Its slopes are draped in lush groves of laurel trees, their silvery leaves shimmering like coins under the sun. The earth beneath these trees holds treasures—rich seams of precious metals and gleaming veins of jade, buried deep within the mountain’s core, coveted by kings and artisans alike.

Amid the greenery of Zhaoyao grows a peculiar plant, a delicate grass known as Zhuyu. Its long, slender blades resemble leeks, but the tiny green blossoms that sprout from its stalks set it apart. Those who consume Zhuyu need not fear hunger, for it nourishes the body for days with just a single meal. Higher up the mountain, hidden among the dense foliage, is a tree of legend. Known as Mi, this tree’s bark is as dark as night, with veins of silver twisting through it like ancient runes. When it flowers, its blossoms erupt in a dazzling light, radiating in all directions, turning the mountain night into day. Those who wear a Mi blossom find their way with ease, never losing their direction even in the thickest of fogs or the darkest of nights.

But Zhaoyao Mountain is not only home to wondrous flora. Within its dense forests dwells a wild creature known as the Xingxing. Resembling an ape but with distinct white-tufted ears, the Xingxing moves with an intelligence that seems almost human. It is a large creature, standing four or five feet tall, with a broad, sunken nose and a set of sharp, pointed teeth—32 in total. The Xingxing, like a solitary craftsman, builds its shelter with leaves and branches, fashioning intricate huts deep within the forest’s heart. Should it be captured young, the Xingxing can be tamed, growing loyal and affectionate to its human companions. Ancient stories tell that eating the flesh of the Xingxing granted incredible speed, allowing warriors to race through the forests as swiftly as a mountain wind.

Long ago, when the southern lands were sweltering and humid, the lush jungles of Zhaoyao teemed with life. Creatures like the Xingxing roamed freely, moving through the thick canopies in large groups, their calls echoing through the valleys below. Some elders believed that the Xingxing could speak in the language of men, though they rarely revealed this secret. It was said that they knew all things of the past, though their knowledge of the future was clouded. Strangely, the Xingxing were also known for their greed, particularly for two things: the strong rice wines brewed by the mountain folk and the simple charm of woven straw sandals.

The villagers, familiar with the Xingxing’s cravings, devised clever traps. They would lay out pots of wine along the mountain paths and leave pairs of straw sandals—linked together in rows—just beside them. The Xingxing, though wary, would often pass by these offerings, shouting the names of the villagers and cursing them for their trickery: "You cannot fool us! We know your plans!" But time and again, the scent of the wine and the sight of the sandals would lure them back. They would pace around the offerings, grumbling and hurling curses at the wind, yet the temptation always proved too great. Finally, with a resigned shout, the Xingxing would drink the wine and slip into the sandals, laughing and playing like children. It was then, in their drunken stupor, that the villagers would emerge from the shadows, capturing the creatures as they stumbled, entangled in the connected sandals.

Though the Xingxing knew the villagers' tricks, their greed made them easy prey. Once caught, they became food for the hunters, and their lips, in particular, were prized as one of the "Eight Delicacies of the Mountain." The ancient people believed that by consuming the flesh of a powerful creature, they could absorb its strength and vitality. The lips of the Xingxing were said to be sweet and tender, and those who ate them would gain the creature’s fabled speed, moving with an unmatched lightness of foot. Over time, as the demand for their flesh grew, the Xingxing population dwindled, and they eventually disappeared from Zhaoyao’s forests, leaving only their stories behind.

Beyond its strange flora and fauna, Zhaoyao Mountain also gave birth to the Liji River. This river begins as a trickling stream high on the mountain’s slopes, gathering strength as it winds its way through the valleys and rushes westward into the sea. In its waters, one can find smooth stones called Yupei, which glow with an inner light. The people of the land believe that wearing a Yupei stone prevents illness, particularly the dreaded Gu sickness that causes the body to swell and weaken. 

Thus, Zhaoyao Mountain stands as a place of both danger and wonder, its peaks hiding secrets of ancient creatures, rare plants, and healing waters, waiting for those daring enough to seek them out.



**ZHAOYAO MOUNTAIN**

**EXT. QISHAN MOUNTAIN RANGE – DAY**

*The camera pans across the vast mountain range, its peaks stretching far into the distance. The sky is overcast, casting a dim light over the dense forests below. The first and westernmost peak, Zhaoyao Mountain, looms large against the horizon. Laurel trees sway gently in the wind, and veins of precious metals glisten faintly in the mountain's jagged cliffs.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
(steady and mysterious)  
In the southern lands lies the mighty Qishan Mountain Range, where the first and most western peak, Zhaoyao Mountain, stands. Rich in treasures—its soil thick with metal and jade—it guards its secrets fiercely. But it is not only wealth that Zhaoyao offers. Within its shadows, wonders and dangers alike lie in wait.

**EXT. ZHAOYAO MOUNTAIN SLOPES – DAY**

*We see a stretch of the mountain covered in wild greenery. A strange grass, called *Zhuyu*, sways in the breeze, its green flowers gently brushing the rocks.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
A peculiar grass, called Zhuyu, grows here. It is said that whoever eats of this plant shall know no hunger. One taste sustains the body, keeping both man and beast from feeling the need for food.

*The camera zooms in on the thick canopy where a mysterious tree with dark bark and silver veins looms. Its blossoms begin to bloom, casting bright beams of light across the forest floor.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
(whispers)  
And higher still, hidden deep within the forest, grows the Mi tree. Its bark as dark as midnight, it blooms only rarely—but when it does, its radiant light shines across the valley. The light of its blossoms has guided many a traveler home, for those who carry the Mi blossom never lose their way.

**EXT. ZHAOYAO MOUNTAIN FOREST – DAY**

*Rustling is heard in the dense forest. Suddenly, a strange creature appears. It moves swiftly, its white-tufted ears twitching, and its large body walking upright with almost human-like grace. The camera follows the creature as it builds a small shelter from leaves, arranging them meticulously.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
But Zhaoyao Mountain is home to more than plants. The forest belongs to the Chijing—a creature as mysterious as the mountain itself. Resembling an ape but far more cunning, the Chijing is said to have the mind of a man and the strength of a beast.

*The creature pauses, sniffing the air. Its sunken nose wrinkles, and it bares its sharp teeth before continuing its work.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
It is said that the Chijing, with its white ears and sunken nose, knows the secrets of the mountain. Its strength is great, its speed unmatched. Legends say that if one were to consume its flesh, they, too, would inherit its swiftness.

**INT. VILLAGE HUT – NIGHT**

*Inside a dimly lit village hut, several **VILLAGERS** sit around a fire. An elder, **OLD MAN**, speaks to the group in hushed tones. **YOUNG VILLAGER** listens intently, his eyes wide with wonder.*

**OLD MAN**  
(grimly)  
The Chijing... they say it knows the names of men and can speak our tongue. They travel in great numbers, through the valleys and forests, keeping their secrets close. But they are greedy—greedy for wine and the sandals woven from straw.

**YOUNG VILLAGER**  
(astonished)  
They know our names?

**OLD MAN**  
(chuckling darkly)  
Oh, they do. And they know the names of our ancestors. You lay a pot of wine on the road, leave a trail of straw sandals... they’ll curse you for trying to trick them. But they always return. They cannot resist.

**EXT. FOREST CLEARING – DUSK**

*The villagers are crouched behind large boulders, peering at the edge of the clearing. A **VILLAGER** carefully sets down a pot of rice wine on the path and arranges a line of straw sandals nearby. They retreat into the shadows.*

*Moments pass. Then, the bushes rustle. A **CHIJING** appears, pacing nervously around the offering, eyes glowing in the dim light. It sniffs the air, casting suspicious glances around.*

**CHIJING**  
(shouting)  
You think you can fool me again? You lay this trap as your ancestors did! I will not fall for it!

*The creature snarls and turns away. But after a few steps, it pauses, glances back, its gaze lingering on the wine. It returns, pacing back and forth before finally giving in. It drinks deeply from the wine and slips its feet into the straw sandals, chuckling to itself.*

**CHIJING**  
(laughing)  
Foolish humans… always tempting…

*Suddenly, the **VILLAGERS** rush from their hiding places, nets in hand. The **CHIJING** stumbles drunkenly, tripping over the sandals connected to each other. It lets out a wild cry but is too intoxicated and entangled to escape. The villagers capture it, dragging it away triumphantly.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
(mysterious)  
Though wise and cunning, the Chijing could not resist its greed. And thus, the mountain folk would feast on its flesh, believing that by eating of the Chijing, they would inherit its strength and speed. 

**EXT. LUSH RIVERBANK – DAY**

*The camera follows the **LIJI RIVER** as it winds down from the mountain, its clear waters glistening in the sunlight. Along its banks, people kneel, cupping the water in their hands, while others collect smooth, luminous stones from the riverbed.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
And from Zhaoyao Mountain flows the Liji River, a mighty water that rushes to the sea. In its depths, the stones known as Yupei lie, their glow said to ward off sickness. Those who wear a Yupei stone are protected from the Gu disease, and their bodies remain strong.

*The camera pulls back, revealing the full majesty of the mountain and its rivers, as mist swirls around its peak.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
(softly)  
Zhaoyao Mountain… a place of wonders and perils, where the earth hides treasures, and the creatures of legend still roam.

**SCENE 1: THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF ZHAOYAO MOUNTAIN**

**EXT. QISHAN MOUNTAIN RANGE – SUNSET**

*The scene opens with a wide shot of the Qishan Mountain Range. Dark clouds roll over the horizon, casting a dramatic shadow over the mountains. The camera slowly zooms in on Zhaoyao Mountain, the westernmost and tallest of them all. As the sun sets, its light casts an eerie orange glow over the laurel trees that blanket the mountain’s lower slopes. Glimpses of glistening veins of metal and jade sparkle faintly in the waning sunlight.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
(serene, ancient)  
In the south lies a range of mountains, vast and untamed. Among them, Zhaoyao Mountain stands tallest—its heart rich with treasures, its secrets whispered only to those who dare to listen.

*The camera lingers on the trees swaying in the wind, their leaves rustling as if whispering stories from centuries past. We hear the distant cries of mysterious creatures echoing through the valley.*

---

**SCENE 2: THE ENCHANTED FLORA OF THE MOUNTAIN**

**EXT. ZHAOYAO MOUNTAIN SLOPES – MORNING**

*The next shot takes us closer to the mountain. Dew clings to the wild grasses, including the peculiar *Zhuyu*, with its green flowers swaying like a river of emerald. The camera moves through the grass, focusing on the strange beauty of the plants, their colors vibrant against the grey rock.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
In these hills grows the Zhuyu, a grass of legend. Its leaves resemble the humble leek, but its flowers glow green. Those who consume it will never know hunger again.

*As we move deeper into the forest, the scenery changes. The camera glides past towering trees until it focuses on a strange tree with bark so dark it seems to absorb the light around it. Its blossoms, though sparse, emit beams of light that cut through the mist.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
High upon the mountain grows the Mi tree. Its blossoms, rare and radiant, shine like the stars themselves. It is said that those who carry its light will never lose their way.

*We see a wanderer, **WANDERER**, tired and lost, stumble upon the Mi tree. He picks one of the blossoms, holding it up as it casts a faint light, illuminating a path through the forest. A look of hope crosses his face.*

---

**SCENE 3: FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE CHIJING**

**EXT. ZHAOYAO MOUNTAIN FOREST – DUSK**

*The camera cuts to the dense underbrush. A low growl is heard, and then, without warning, a strange beast emerges. It is the **CHIJING**, its white ears twitching as it cautiously steps out from the shadows. The creature moves with unnerving grace, switching between crawling on all fours and walking upright like a human.*

*The **CHIJING** stops at a small clearing, inspecting the area, its sunken nose twitching as it senses something nearby. The camera zooms in on its sharp eyes, which dart left and right, scanning for danger. It then begins to construct a small hut using leaves and branches, working with deliberate, intelligent movements.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
And here, hidden in the heart of Zhaoyao, is the Chijing. Neither man nor beast, it builds its home from the leaves and speaks in ways no human can understand. Its strength is unmatched, and its mind is sharp, like that of a man.

*As it finishes the hut, the **CHIJING** looks up suddenly, staring directly into the camera as if sensing the viewer's presence. It bares its teeth and snarls before disappearing into the dense forest.*

---

**SCENE 4: THE LEGEND OF THE CHIJING**

**INT. VILLAGE HUT – NIGHT**

*A crackling fire illuminates the faces of a small group of **VILLAGERS**. An elder, **OLD MAN**, sits by the fire, his voice low and grave as he recounts the ancient stories. A **YOUNG VILLAGER** sits closest to him, listening with wide-eyed awe.*

**OLD MAN**  
(gravely)  
The Chijing knows much. It knows the names of men, the names of their fathers and their fathers’ fathers. It travels the valleys in packs, more than a hundred strong, their footsteps silent as the wind. They know the past... but they cannot see the future.

*The camera focuses on the **YOUNG VILLAGER** as he leans forward, captivated by the story.*

**YOUNG VILLAGER**  
(surprised)  
But if they’re so wise, how do we catch them?

**OLD MAN**  
(smirking)  
Ah... for all their wisdom, the Chijing are greedy. They love wine. And they cannot resist the feel of straw sandals beneath their feet.

---

**SCENE 5: SETTING THE TRAP**

**EXT. FOREST CLEARING – DUSK**

*The scene cuts to a group of **VILLAGERS** hiding behind a rocky outcrop, their faces tense with anticipation. One of the **VILLAGERS** sets a pot of rice wine in the center of the clearing and carefully arranges a trail of straw sandals around it.*

*The camera zooms in on the pot, the wine inside rippling slightly as the wind blows. The **VILLAGERS** retreat into the shadows, watching silently.*

*After a moment, the bushes rustle. A **CHIJING** appears, cautiously approaching the clearing. It sniffs the air, its glowing eyes narrowing as it approaches the wine. It seems to understand the trap but is drawn closer by its desire.*

**CHIJING**  
(angrily)  
You think you can trick me as your fathers did? I will not fall for this again!

*The **CHIJING** paces back and forth, cursing the humans, but its gaze keeps returning to the pot of wine. Eventually, it can no longer resist. It lunges forward, drinking deeply from the wine before slipping its feet into the straw sandals.*

*The **CHIJING** lets out a drunken laugh, but before it can react, the **VILLAGERS** spring from their hiding places, throwing nets over the creature. The **CHIJING** stumbles, unable to run with the sandals tangled together.*

---

**SCENE 6: THE LIPS OF THE CHIJING**

**INT. VILLAGE FEAST – NIGHT**

*The villagers celebrate around a grand fire. A feast is laid out before them, and at the center of the table is the roasted **CHIJING**. The camera focuses on the lips of the creature, roasted to a golden brown. **YOUNG VILLAGER** stares at the food in awe.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
Ancient belief held that the flesh of the Chijing carried with it the power of speed and strength. By consuming its lips, they believed they would walk faster, run swifter, and gain the might of the creature itself.

*The camera lingers on the villagers eating, their movements slow and deliberate. As they feast, a sense of quiet reverence fills the air.*

---

**SCENE 7: THE LIVING WATERS OF THE LIJI RIVER**

**EXT. RIVERBANK – DAY**

*The scene transitions to the **LIJI RIVER**, rushing down from the mountains and into the sea. The camera follows the water’s journey, moving downstream as it winds through the forest.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
From Zhaoyao’s highest peaks flows the Liji River. Its waters, pure and swift, carry with them the stones known as Yupei—gems of life, protection, and healing.

*On the riverbank, a small group of **VILLAGERS** wade into the water, collecting glowing stones from the riverbed. One **WOMAN** holds a Yupei stone to her chest, a look of peace on her face.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
Those who wear the Yupei are said to be guarded from sickness, their bodies free from the ravages of time and disease.

---

**SCENE 8: FINAL REVEAL OF ZHAOYAO MOUNTAIN**

**EXT. ZHAOYAO MOUNTAIN – SUNSET**

*The final shot is an expansive aerial view of Zhaoyao Mountain, its peak shrouded in mist, the rivers flowing into the sea, and the forest below teeming with life. The light from the Mi tree’s blossoms can be seen faintly glowing from within the forest.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
Zhaoyao Mountain—a place of ancient wonders, fierce creatures, and hidden treasures. Its secrets may never be fully known, but for those who venture into its depths, the mountain offers gifts beyond imagination.

*The camera pulls back further, revealing the full majesty of the mountain as the screen fades to black.*

**FADE OUT.**
